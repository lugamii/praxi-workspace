# praxi-workspace
A workspace for Praxi, Zoot, SpigotX &amp; FairFight

# Compiling
Just use 'mvn clean install' on the main folder :P

# Using
You can use the 'server' folder as a base. <br>
You'll require MongoDB & Redis to run this.

# Notes
- This is not bugfixed at all.

# Credits
- Me (for the workspace & server)
- MineXD (for making the plugins)
